As you can see from above result, as number of training samples increases, the accuracy first increases, then decreases.
This is expected because at the beginning, the model is underfitting. Increase training samples will make it has better generalization.
However, as training samples keep increasing, the model is overfitting, which causes decrease in accuracy.
